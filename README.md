# MiniScala Programming Language
Welcome to the MiniScala programming language, a lightweight, statically typed language inspired by Scala. Developed as a project during the Programming Languages course in the second semester of computer science, this language serves as a simplified subset of Scala, focusing on essential features such as variables, types, functions, lambdas, conditional statements, and loops.

## Explore the code
The main files for the MiniScala interpreter are located in the src/miniscala directory. Notably, Interpreter.scala and TypeChecker.scala play crucial roles in the project.
The /examples folder contains .s files, which are MiniScala code snippets ready to be interpreted and executed.
